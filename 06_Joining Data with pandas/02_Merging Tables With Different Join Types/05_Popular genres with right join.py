05 - Popular genres with right join

What  are  the genres of the most popular  movies?  To  answer  this  question, 
you need to  merge  data  from  the  movies  and  movie_to_genres tables. In a 
table called pop_movies, the top 10 most popular movies in  the  movies  table 
have been selected. To ensure  that  you  are  analyzing  all  of  the  popular 
movies, merge it with the movie_to_genres table using a right join. To complete 
your analysis, count the number of different genres. Also, the two tables can be 
merged by the movie ID. However, in pop_movies that column is called id, and in 
movies_to_genres it's called movie_id.

The pop_movies and movie_to_genres tables have been loaded for you.
