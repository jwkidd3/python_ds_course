01 - Counting missing rows with left join

The Movie Database is supported by volunteers  going  out into  the  world, 
collecting data, and entering it into the database. This includes financial
data, such as movie budget and revenue. If you wanted to know which  movies 
are still missing data, you could use a left join to identify them. Practice 
using a left join by merging the movies table and the financials table.

The movies and financials tables have been loaded for you.

What column is likely the best column to merge the two tables on?

Possible Answers
 - on='budget'[X]
 - on='popularity'[X]
 - on='id'[âœ“]

 2 - Merge the movies table, as the left table, with the financials
     table using a left join, and save the result to movies_financials.

3 - Count the number of rows in movies_financials with a null value in
    the budget column.
