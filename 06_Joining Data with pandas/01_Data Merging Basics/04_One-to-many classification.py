04 - One-to-many classification

Understanding the difference between a one-to-one and one-to-many relationship 
is a useful skill. In this exercise, consider a set of tables from an e-commerce 
website. The hypothetical tables are the following:

- A customer table with information about each customer
- A cust_tax_info table with customers unique tax IDs
- An orders table with information about each order
- A products table with details about each unique product sold
- An inventory table with information on how much total inventory is available to 
  sell for each product

Instructions:

Select the relationship type that is most appropriate for the relationship between 
the different tables: One-to-one, or One-to-many.
