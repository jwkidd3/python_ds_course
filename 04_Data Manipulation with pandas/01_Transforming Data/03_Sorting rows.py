03 - Sorting rows

Finding interesting bits of data in a DataFrame is often easier if you change the
order of the rows. You can sort the rows by passing a column name to .sort_values().

In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical
variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort
on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.

|Sort on …            |	Syntax                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
|- one column         | - df.sort_values("breed")                |
|- multiple columns   | - df.sort_values(["breed", "weight_kg"]) |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|

By combining .sort_values() with .head(), you can answer questions in the form,
"What are the top cases where…?".

Instructions:

 1. Sort homelessness by the number of homeless individuals, from smallest to largest,
    and save this as homelessness_ind.

    - Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.
 
 2. Sort homelessness by the number of homeless family_members in descending order, and
    save this as homelessness_fam.

    - Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.

 3. Sort homelessness first by region (ascending), and then by number of family members
   (descending). Save this as homelessness_reg_fam.

    - Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.
