04 - Sorting by index values:
Previously, you changed the order of the rows in a DataFrame by calling .sort_values(). 
It's also useful to be able to sort by elements in the  index. For this,  you need  to  
use .sort_index().

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_ind has a multi-level index  of  country  and city,
and is available.

Instructions:

 - Sort temperatures_ind by the index values.
 
 - Sort temperatures_ind by the index values at the "city" level.
 
 - Sort temperatures_ind by ascending country then descending city.
