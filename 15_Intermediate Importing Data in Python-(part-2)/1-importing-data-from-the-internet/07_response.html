          I am retired, working on personal projects (and maybe a book).
    I have worked for Dropbox, Google, Elemental Security, Zope
    Corporation, BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA.  (See

           How to Reach Me
          </h3>
          <p>
           You can send email for me to guido (at) python.org.
    I read everything sent there, but I receive too much email to respond
    to everything.
           <h3>
            My Name
           </h3>
           <p>
            My name often poses difficulties for Americans.
            <p>
             <b>
              Pronunciation:
             </b>
             in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G,
    pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".  (Listen to the
             <a href="guido.au">
              sound clip
             </a>
             .)  However, if you're
    American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido".  I'm not
    too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people
    have. :-)
             <p>
              <b>
               Spelling:
              </b>
              my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it
    that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding.
    Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my
    first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum".  But when my
    last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for
    example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."
              <p>
               <b>
                Alphabetization:
               </b>
               in America, I show up in the alphabet under
    "V".  But in Europe, I show up under "R".  And some of my friends put
    me under "G" in their address book...
